# clima_weather_detector

An app made in flutter that is able to look up the weather for any town anywhere using real-time data from OpenWeatherMap. Made as part of a udemy course I am taking. Accesses the phone's physical location in order to give the current weather for that location but is also able of looking up weather for any city in the whole dang world. 

## Final Result

##### I am not actually in Newport. 

Worth noting that I did make some custom artwork feature my cat, Bernina, for each of the different weather conditions. I am very very proud of those. I played around with adding some additional functionality that goes beyond that of the course. 


## I am availible for commissions on those cat drawings.

# clima_weather_detector

An app made in flutter that is able to look up the weather for any town anywhere using real-time data from OpenWeatherMap. Made as part of a udemy course I am taking. Accesses the phone's physical location in order to give the current weather for that location but is also able of looking up weather for any city in the whole dang world. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you try to run this repo, it will not work since I have removed my OpenWeatherMap API key so that no one steals it and I get charged a bunch of money. You can get a free API key from https://openweathermap.org/api. You can then just sub that key into the const kApiKey in lib/services/weather. Thanks!

##### I am not actually in Newport. 

Worth noting that I did make some custom artwork featuring my cat, Bernina, for each of the different weather conditions. I am very very proud of those. I played around with adding some additional functionality that goes beyond that of the Udemy course that I am taking. 


## I am availible for commissions on those cat drawings.
